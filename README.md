# Dashboard Maker

**An Owlbear Rodeo extension for keeping game content you need on hand.**

Whether it's useful notes & reminders, initiative trackers, character sheets, or something else, Dashboard Maker is a place to put it. All content is saved in your browser.

The more you put in Dashboard Maker, the less you have to leave Owlbear Rodeo. Why is this good? Because context switching during a game sucks.

Check it out as a standalone app here: https://owlbear-dashboard-maker.vercel.app/

_(But really, you should be using this in [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/))_

Dashboard Maker comes with a couple of "Premades". These are dashboards that are already there, with some useful DM Screen info particular to D&D 5th Edition.

More "Premades" to come.

## Features

* You can delete dashboards as needed
* You can lock/unlock the state of a dashboard, affecting the editable state of the items within it.
* You can clone/duplicate any dashboard as needed
  * Right now, this is the best way to rename them (duplicate it, give it a new name, and then delete the old one)
* You can also download/upload dashboards as `json` files, so you can store them offline, share them between browsers, etc!


## Formatting
Here are some text formatting guidelines to help share what's possible with Dashboard Maker.

### Headings
Type `#` and then hit `space` to create an `h1` in the body of your dashboard item text. This pattern applies to `h2`'s (`##`), `h3`'s (`###`), and so on.

### Text Styling
You can apply bold, italics, and underline to text by using the keyboard shortcuts: `ctrl+b` for bold, `ctrl+i` for italics, and `ctrl+u` for underline.

Make sure to use `command` instead of `ctrl` on a mac. ðŸ˜Š

### Checkboxes
Type `[]` and then `space` to create a checkbox. Make sure you type in a label to the right of the checkbox immediately after, or else if you hit return the checkbox will just disappear.

### Bulleted Lists
Type `-` and then hit `space` to create a bulleted list. you can indent lists however much you need using the `tab` key.

### Numbered Lists
Type `1.` and then hit `space` to create a numbered list starting at 1. You can also indent numbered lists with `tab`.

### Code Formatting
To make your text have `that cool code` look, type a backtick ( ` ), followed by the text you want formatted this way, followed by another backtick.

_Have fun!_
