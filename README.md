## Features

### Blank Dashboards

Click **Create A New Dashboard** to create a new empty dashboard space. Fill it with useful notes, reminders, and any other useful content you want on-hand. Next time you need to recall a story beat or a rules detail, put it in Dashboard Maker so that you never have to change contexts by leaving Owlbear.

### 5e Character Template

Click **Create A New 5e Character** to create a new dashboard space, using a 5e Character Template.

### Premades

Dashboard Maker comes with a couple of "Premades" - dashboards that are just already there for you, with some useful DM Screen info particular to D&D 5th Edition.

I plan to add more Premades as I go, so expect to see more here whenever you return to the extension.
